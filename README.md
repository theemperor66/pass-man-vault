# pass-man-vault

A secure semi-decentralized cryptographic password manager.

## What is it?
Passman is a password manager that uses a cowombination of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography to encrypt and decrypt passwords. It is designed to be semi-decentralized, meaning that the passwords are stored on a server, but the server does not have access to the passwords. The server only has access to the encrypted passwords, and the keys to decrypt them. The server is only used to store the encrypted passwords, and to provide a way to access them from multiple devices.
What makes this special is that even though the server can't access the passwords they still can be shared between users roles and teams.
